<h1>A little bit about Jason</h1>
<p>I am a 24 year old from Boston Massachusetts and I just finished college
with a communications degree. I am the junior varsity coach for Brighton Boys
Basketball team (year 3).
While coaching I make sure to be an outlet that the kids
can come to for relatively anything.
I am also a very outgoing individual who always wants
to learn something new which brings me to my next point of why I'm in this
course in the first place.
 For me this a huge step of challenging myself and when
this opportunity presented itself I had to take advantage. I am looking forward
to learning so much throughout the course of 20 weeks. Below I will give you
guys an unordered list of things that I like to induldge in on my down time.</p>

<ul>


<li>Play Basketball</li>
<li>Read Books</li>
<li>Spend time with family</li>
<li>Watch Basketball</li>
<li>Workout</li>
<li>watch podcasts</li>
<li>Taking walks in nature</li>


</ul>
